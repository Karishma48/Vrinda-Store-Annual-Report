# Vrinda-Store-Annual-Report
I'm thrilled to present my most recent project, the Vrinda Store Annual Report. This extensive dashboard provides a thorough examination of sales and orders, emphasizing the best-performing months, client buying patterns, the top 10 states that contribute to sales, and the relationship between gender and age in terms of purchasing behavior. 
The method started with the data being obtained from Google, then involved a thorough data cleaning procedure and the development of critical metrics. I carefully considered every aspect, added more columns, and carried out transformations to improve the quality and usefulness of the dataset.
